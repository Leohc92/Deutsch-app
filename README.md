# Deutsch-app
Learner: A German vocabulary app

This is a very simple flashcard app, here's how it works:

1. Get list of Liepzig university top 1000 words in german and english (json)
2. Randomly arrange the top 1000 list of words in two arrays. array1 = english, array2 = german. (Keeping the orders for English and German words the same. E.g. if array2 position for 'Hallo' is 5 then 5 should be the position for 'Hello' in array1.)
3. Randomly add word to document e.g. 'add word from english array with position 5'. Clicking 'show translation' adds the german word 'add word from german array with position 5'.

That's it. It's very simple.
